## ðŸ‘‹ Simon Carlson-Thies
Long-time Macintosh Platform Engineer transitioning into High Performance computing and trying to become a more well rounded technologist. I dabble with lots of things, and embarrassingly little ends up here on Github. I am trying to improve that.
You can find my general blog [here](https://theenterprisemac.com) and my HPC journey blog [here](https://hpcjourney.com). I try to document thoughts and interesting things that I find. It is also a place where I interact with content I findâ€“that may not be suitable for the platform I find the content on. I am opinionated--so beware!
## ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on...
- Becoming and HPC Storage Administrator (currently learning GPFS and troubleshooting for it)
- Improving my Site Reliability Engineering skills
- Digging into the nuts and bolts of how Apple's Private Cloud Compute OS works
- Reverse engineering somethingâ€“depends on the day and often I document on my blog
- Trying to find my next project that I can spend years on...any ideas please share!
## More coming at some point...
